            <p><b>Item #: </b>SCP-YC-004</p>
            <p><b>Object Class: </b>Safe</p>
            <p><b>Special Containment Procedures: </b>SCP-YC-004 should be stored in a iron safe. </p>
            <p><b>Descrition: </b>SCP-YC-004 is a ████ branded camera. A 4 digit decimal float will manifest on the subjects’ photos took using SCP-YS-004. It has been observed that the float is less than 2. The float indicates the time left for the subject before physical death. </p>
